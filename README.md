This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to comparing floating-point numbers for equality.  The `foo` function attempts to compare two numbers, but it fails when the numbers are floating-point values that are very close but not exactly equal due to floating-point precision issues. The solution demonstrates a more robust approach using a tolerance value to handle the imprecision.
